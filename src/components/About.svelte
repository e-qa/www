  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello! I'm a passionate Frontend Developer with a keen eye for clean,
    functional design and a love for creating engaging web applications. I
    specialize in crafting interactive and user-friendly experiences using
    modern technologies like React and Next. My approach combines a deep
    understanding of JavaScript and a focus on intuitive user interfaces to
    bring ideas to life. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new
    design trends, experimenting with sound effects in Tone.js, or working on
    personal projects to push my skills further. My goal is to build web
    applications that are not only visually appealing but also highly functional
    and enjoyable to use.
